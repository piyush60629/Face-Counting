# Face Counting with OpenCV

## Project Description
The Face Counting with OpenCV project utilizes computer vision techniques to count the number of faces present in a webcam feed. It employs OpenCV library along with Haar cascade classifier for face detection. The project provides a simple yet effective solution for face counting applications.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Haar Cascade Classifier

## Features
- **Face Detection:** Utilizes Haar cascade classifier to detect faces in real-time webcam feed.
- **Face Counting:** Counts the number of faces detected in the webcam feed.
- **Simple Interface:** Provides a straightforward interface for viewing the webcam feed and the counted number of faces.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/piyush60629/Face-Counting.git

Install OpenCV:

    pip install opencv-python
  
Run the script:

    python app.py
  
## Project Structure

**face_count.py:** Main Python script for face counting with OpenCV.
**haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml:** Haar cascade classifier file for face detection.
